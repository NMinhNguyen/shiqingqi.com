This is the repository for my personal website.

This website uses an Express server, and experiments with Polymer web components.

## To-do List
- Use HTTPS for encryption
- Use HTTP 2 for server push

## Environment
Requires NodeJS, NPM and Bower.

## Installation
If haven't already, install bower as global:

        > npm install -g bower

Navigate to the base folder of the repository in the terminal, and use the following command to install Node modules:

        > npm install

Install bower components:

        > bower install

## Usage
Navigate back to the base folder of the repository, then use the following to start a local server on http://localhost:3000 (or use environment variables to specify the port for Express):

        > npm start
